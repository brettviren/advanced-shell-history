= Introduction =

The history database is covered by these two tables - sessions and commands.


= Schema =
=== Sessions ===
|| *Column* || *Type* || *Size* || *Nullable* || *Default* || *Description* ||
||id||integer||11|| √ ||null||The session ID.||
||hostname||varchar||128|| √ ||null||The hostname where the session began.||
||host_ip||varchar||40|| √ ||null||The host IP addresses (taken from all available network interfaces) - space separated.||
||ppid||integer||5|| || ||The parent process ID of this shell.||
||pid||integer||5|| || ||The process ID of this shell.||
||time_zone||varchar||3|| || ||The time zone set on this host when the session began.||
||start_time||integer||11|| || ||The start time of this session (in seconds since epoch time) in local time.||
||end_time||integer||11|| √ ||null||The end time of this session (in seconds since epoch time) in local time.||
||duration||integer||11|| √ ||null||The measured duration of this session - in seconds.||
||tty||varchar||20|| || ||The controlling tty when this session began.||
||uid||integer||16|| || ||The UID when the session began.||
||euid||integer||16|| || ||The effective UID when the session began.||
||logname||varchar||48|| √ ||null||The login name of the user when the session began.||
||shell||varchar||50|| || ||The shell name (bash, zsh, etc) of the session.||
||sudo_user||varchar||48|| √ ||null||If set, this implies that the session began as a sudo su to someone else.  This is possibly set to the previous user (who invoked sudo).||
||sudo_uid||integer||16|| √ ||null||If set, this implies that the session began as a sudo su to someone else.  This is possibly set to the previous user ID.||
||ssh_client||varchar||60|| √ ||null||If set, this contains the value of the SSH_CLIENT shell environment variable.||
||ssh_connection||varchar||100|| √ ||null||If set, this contains the value of the SSH_CONNECTION shell environment variable.||

=== Commands ===
|| *Column* || *Type* || *Size* || *Nullable* || *Default* || *Description* ||
||id||integer||11|| √ ||null||The row id for this command (populated by a DB sequence).||
||session_id||integer||11|| || ||The session id - see the sessions table.||
||shell_level||integer||11|| || ||The shell variable SHLVL.||
||command_no||integer||11|| √ ||null||The shell builtin history command number.||
||tty||varchar||20|| || ||The tty where the command was executed.||
||euid||integer||16|| || ||The effective user ID when the command was entered.||
||cwd||varchar||256|| || ||The current working directory where the command was entered.||
||rval||integer||5|| || ||The exit code of the command - equal to ${?}||
||start_time||integer||11|| || ||The start time (in seconds since epoch) UTC when the command was entered.||
||end_time||integer||11|| || ||The end time (in seconds since epoch) UTC when the command completed.||
||duration||integer||11|| || ||The time measured between start and stop of the command.||
||pipe_cnt||integer||3|| √ ||null||The number of piped commands entered.||
||pipe_vals||varchar||80|| √ ||null||The exit codes of each individual piped command - separated by underscores.||

=== Details ===

Whenever a new session begins, the session-specific data is collected once and inserted into the DB.  A new session ID is created and saved into the shell environment as a variable.

Whenever a command-line prompt is drawn, the previous command is logged into the database before the user can enter the next command.


=== Tips ===

Download and install sqlite3 so you can query your history database manually.  Save queries you like in your ~/.ash/queries file and invoke them from the command line with the ash_query command.
